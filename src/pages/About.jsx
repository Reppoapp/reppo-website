              <p>
                We were tired of fake fitness programs that claimed to be used by elite athletes 
                but had no proof. The fitness industry was full of marketing content disguised as training programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's when we realized: what if you could train WITH your favorite athletes using 
                                 their actual workout data? What if your favorite athlete finishing their morning workout meant 
                you could do a personalized version of that exact workout?
              </p>
              <p>
                We built the technology to make this possible. Live data from Garmin and Apple Watch devices, 
                AI personalization that scales workouts to your level, and a platform that connects you 
                directly with verified elite athletes.
